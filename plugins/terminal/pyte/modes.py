    pyte.modes
    ~~~~~~~~~~

    This module defines terminal mode switches, used by
    :class:`~pyte.screens.Screen`. There're two types of terminal modes:

    * `non-private` which should be set with ``ESC [ N h``, where ``N``
      is an integer, representing mode being set; and
    * `private` which should be set with ``ESC [ ? N h``.

    The latter are shifted 5 times to the right, to be easily
    distinguishable from the former ones; for example `Origin Mode`
    -- :data:`DECOM` is ``192`` not ``6``.

    >>> DECOM
    192
