Contributing to Ajenti
======================

Translations
------------

All translations are stored by `Crowdin <https://crowdin.com/>`_, and any help is welcome.
It's possible to translate directly all strings in the great interface of Crowdin and then we can include and compile it into the next release:

`Ajenti on Crowdin <https://crowdin.com/project/ajenti>`_


Testing
-------

It's always good to have some users feedback, because we may oversee some problems. If you find an issue, please post it on `GitHub <https://github.com/ajenti/ajenti/issues>`_ with a complete description of the problem, and we will try to solve it and improve Ajenti.

Developping
-----------

There's two main axes to develop Ajenti :
  * :ref:`Extension plugins <setup-devenv-extension-plugins>`: like e.g. a plugin to manage the fstab file,
  * :ref:`Core <setup-devenv-core>`: improve Ajenti on server side.
